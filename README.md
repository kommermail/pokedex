# pokedex
This is a project I did for my honors course in 'Python for Everybody Specialization' by University of Michigan on Coursera.com.

The files named pdexmodel.py and  pokemon.py are my python code.
The file named pdexjson.json is a dataset in json that I downloaded from user jdorfman on GitHub.

For my Kanto Pokedex project, I created two python files: one for creating a database of the data that I acquired from another GitHub user, and one for modeling that data in a bubble chart.  

The data contains statistics for Pokemon from the Kanto region (Pokemon are fantasy monsters that battle to see who gets knocked out first, but don't worry, they get healed up afterwards.)  This data consists of things like the Pokemon's type (what element they represent, such as Fire or Water), their weaknesses, their height and weight, and their name.

The analysis that I did was to find the Pokemon with the smallest body and the least weaknesses, and the Pokemon with the largest body and the most weaknesses.  I think that a bubble chart is perfect for this and other analyses, such as "is 'Pokemon x' strong or weak, and in what ways?"

After a lot of googling and messing around with regular expressions and SQL joining and everything, I arrived with a working python script to use Plotly and pandas to make a bubble chart of my data.

Anyway, I had a lot of fun doing this, and if anyone has any questions, corrections, or comments I'd be happy to answer them.
